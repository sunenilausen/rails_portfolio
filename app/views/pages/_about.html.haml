      I am a Web developer who loves making sites, apps, games and more. I have a MSc. in Computer Science, with my master thesis being in machine intelligence. I am especially interested in development and design of modern software. I grew up on the country near Gr√∏nbjerg, a little westjutlandic village. As a person I am always ready for new and exciting projects as it is a great way to expand your competences. My nature is to be creative, friendly, calm and social.
